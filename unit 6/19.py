"""
To analyze the accuracy and efficiency of the Smith-Waterman algorithm, 
we can compare its results with the known correct alignment of two sequences and measure the time it takes to compute the alignment.

For example, we can use the Smith-Waterman algorithm to align two DNA sequences and compare the resulting alignment with the known alignment. 
We can use a benchmark dataset such as the BAliBASE benchmark to evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm.

To measure the efficiency of the algorithm, we can record the time it takes to align different pairs of sequences of varying lengths 
and analyze the running time as a function of the sequence length. We can also compare the running time of the Smith-Waterman algorithm with
other algorithms such as the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to evaluate its efficiency.

Finally, we can also analyze the space complexity of the algorithm by measuring the amount of memory it requires to align sequences of different lengths. 
This can be important for large-scale applications such as genome sequencing where memory limitations can be a bottleneck.
