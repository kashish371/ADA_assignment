"""
To analyze the approximation ratio of this algorithm, let OPT be the size of the optimal solution and 
let C be the size of the solution produced by the algorithm. Then, we have:

C <= ln(n) * OPT

To see why this is true, consider the following argument. Let k be the number of sets chosen by the algorithm and 
let S_1, S_2, ..., S_k be the chosen sets in the order they were added to the solution. For each i from 1 to k, let U_i be the set of uncovered elements 
before S_i was added to the solution. Then we have:

|U_1| >= |U_2| >= ... >= |U_k| >= 0

Furthermore, for each i from 1 to k, we have:

|S_i| <= ln(n) * |U_i|

This is because the algorithm chose the set S_i that covers the largest number of uncovered elements at each step, 
and the size of any set is at most ln(n) times the number of uncovered elements it covers. Therefore, we have:

|C| = |S_1| + |S_2| + ... + |S_k|
<= ln(n) * |U_1| + ln(n) * |U_2| + ... + ln(n) * |U_k|
= ln(n) * (|U_1| + |U_2| + ... + |U_k|)
= ln(n) * |U|

where |U| is the size of the universe. Since |U| = OPT, we have:

C <= ln(n) * OPT

Thus, the approximation ratio of the greedy algorithm for the Set Cover Problem is ln(n).
