17. Create a flowchart for a linear search algorithm.

Start
|
V
Set target value to search for
|
V
Set index counter to 0
|
V
While index counter is less than length of array
|
|---If value at index counter equals target value
|
|       |---Yes: Return index counter
|
|       |---No: Increment index counter
|
V
Return -1 (indicating that the target value was not found)
|
V
End
