//Create a flowchart for a heap data structure and use it to sort an array of integers.

START

1. Build a max-heap from the input array
     a. Start from the middle of the array and work backwards
     b. For each element, swap it with its largest child if the child is greater
     c. Continue this process until the element is in its correct position
2. Sort the input array in ascending order
     a. While the heap is not empty:
          i. Remove the root element (which is the largest element in the heap)
          ii. Swap it with the last element in the heap
          iii. Reduce the heap size by 1
          iv. Restore the heap property by sifting down the new root element
          v. Add the removed element to the end of the sorted array
3. Return the sorted array
