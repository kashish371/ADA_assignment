//Create a flowchart for a hash table data structure using separate chaining collision resolution

START

1. Create a hash table with an array of buckets
2. For each element in the input list:
     a. Compute the hash value of the element's key
     b. Find the corresponding bucket in the hash table
     c. If the bucket is empty, create a new linked list node with the element and add it to the bucket
     d. If the bucket is not empty, search the linked list for an existing node with the same key
          i. If a node with the same key exists, update its value
          ii. If a node with the same key does not exist, create a new linked list node with the element and add it to the end of the list
3. Search for an element in the hash table:
     a. Compute the hash value of the element's key
     b. Find the corresponding bucket in the hash table
     c. If the bucket is empty, the element is not in the hash table
     d. If the bucket is not empty, search the linked list for a node with the same key
          i. If a node with the same key exists, return its value
          ii. If a node with the same key does not exist, the element is not in the hash table
