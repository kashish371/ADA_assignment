# Implement the interval scheduling problem using a greedy approach in flowchart.

 A textual representation of the algorithm for the interval scheduling problem using a greedy approach:

Sort the intervals in increasing order of their end times

Select the interval with the earliest end time

Discard any intervals that intersect with the selected interval

Repeat steps 2-3 until there are no more intervals left

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(nlogn) due to the initial sorting of the intervals. However, the space complexity is O(1) as we are only storing a few variables to keep track of the selected intervals.

It should be noted that this algorithm only provides a suboptimal solution and may not always provide the maximum number
of non-overlapping intervals. A dynamic programming approach can be used to obtain the optimal solution, but at a higher time and space complexity.
