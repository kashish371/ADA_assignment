# Implement the fractional knapsack problem using a greedy approach in flowchart.



the algorithm in pseudo-code:

Calculate the value per unit of each item by dividing its value by its weight.
Sort the items in descending order based on their value per unit.
Set the total weight of the knapsack to 0 and the total value to 0.
For each item in the sorted list:
If adding the entire item will not exceed the capacity of the knapsack, add the item and update the total weight and total value.
If adding the entire item will exceed the capacity of the knapsack,
add a fraction of the item that fits into the knapsack and update the total weight and total value accordingly.
Return the total value of the items added to the knapsack.
